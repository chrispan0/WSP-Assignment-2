        <h3>The Smart Mirror Project</h3>
        <p>
          The Smart Mirror Project is a project that showcases the capabilities
          of a Raspberry Pi in which it created an interactive display that also
          doubled as a mirror which allowed the user to multitask while looking
          at the mirror.

        <h3>Tri Site-To-Site VPN/Personal Intranet</h3>
        <p>
          The project involves setting up a tri-site network topology with a
          site-to-site VPN with IPSec connecting three locations: PTA (Home),
          PBH (Pearl Bridal House), and SIM (Dorm). Each site is connected via a
          secure VPN tunnel, allowing seamless communication between devices
          across different subnets. The network supports centralized backup
          operations using Veeam Backup & Replication, where all critical
          servers and desktops at each site are backed up to a centralized NAS
          located at the PTA site and then backed up to the offsite NAS located
          at the SIM site.
