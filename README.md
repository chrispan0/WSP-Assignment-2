<p>Website: https://wsp-2.chrispanetta.com</p>
<p>This website is hosted on a local Docker Container with Node.JS on my Home Server using Cloudflare Tunnels, hence why it has a custom domain. I own the domain "chrispanetta.com" and any illegal subdomains "*.chrispanetta.com" will take you to my personal website. The Spotify Playlist is the codes that I got off of the internet as made by the Spotify. The code is based on the iframe function while there are API Calls that are custom such as fullscreen and allowautoplay.</p>
<br />
<p>The mkdocker.bat and the Dockerfile are for my server since it is in sync with the repo, it was easier to host the files here.</p>
